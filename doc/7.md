# Working with external data volumes: mounting, copying, and file system architectures

This section of the tutorial is perhaps the most important in terms of the work we do in the CDC and Helpline, and the previous chapters can be seen as leading up to the subjects covered on this page.

When you plug an external hard drive, a hard drive from another computer, or any other mass-storage device into a computer, the files on it are not inherently accessible by the Linux operating system that you are using. This is because all Unix-based operating systems have a file structure that looks like a single tree, with ALL files stemming away from one root directory. The external storage device looks like its own tree, so you are not able to interact with it at first. 'Mounting' a hard drive is the process of essentially attaching the storage device's root directory to a location on the main file system, so it becomes a part of the single-tree file structure

Back in the old days, when Linux was a good deal younger, all external file systems had to be mounted manually after connecting them to the Linux computer. Now, most installations of Linux are able to recognize when an external file system is attached, and are smart enough to automatically mount it to an appropriate location. However, when the external file system is damaged (such as a dying hard drive) or if you are stuck with a command line interface (which is what this guide assumes!), this automatic mounting often doesn't work.


## Mounting: Locations and naming conventions

Prior to mounting an external volume, it is still visible as a device, listed in the directory `/dev/` (which stands for "devices"). This is, for all intents and purposes, just a label that lets you know that there is something plugged in. If the label attached to the volume is `/dev/sdb1`, you cannot `cd` into that location to view the files on the device, because the label isn't a real directory. Instead, this label is used to specify <i>which</i> external file system you are trying to mount when you use the `mount` command.

The `mount` command is fairly intuitive. Standard syntax is `mount <i>device_label</i> <i>mount_location</i>`
