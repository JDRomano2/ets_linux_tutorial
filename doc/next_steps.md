## How to Become a Linux Master

- - -

So now you know the basics of Linux - essentially enough to get by in a pinch. However, like any other arcane and complex computer system, there is far more to go before being on-par with the prototypical UNIX sysadmin. However, tutorials aren't going to get you to that point. Instead, you are going to have to learn by finding the knowledge for yourself.

This is a list of tasks you can follow in order to help accomplish this goal. Note that none of these are covered in the software, and you aren't expected to do them. However, I'm certain that you will find them incredibly rewarding if you have any intention of finding a career in IT or software development. Some aren't for the faint of heart, and none has any single correct way to accomplish the goal.

- Become fluent in at least one of each of the following types of programming languages: an interpreted language, an object-oriented language, a typesetting or markup language, and a scripting language

- Learn how to effectively use either the `vim` or the `emacs` text editor, and use it every time you need to edit text files

- Set up a UNIX web server or email server from scratch (i.e., start from a base installation of Linux and install each component individually) - I recommend doing this on an Amazon EC2 instance running Ubuntu

- Configure a PDP-11 emulator running one of the "ancient" versions of UNIX (i.e., UNIX v.7), and get a program to actually run on it

- Decompile a binary executable program to assembly code using the debugger/disassembler of your choice

- Learn how to use either GNU Screen or (preferrably) TMUX, and have it running whenever you use your terminal emulator

- Study the MMIX operating system, and get an MMIX instance or simulator running correctly

- Create a simple 2D game using SDL/OpenGL in one of the "C" family of programming languages. Be able to successfully build it from both the command line and from a modern IDE.
